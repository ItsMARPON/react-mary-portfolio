        Graduated from St. Catherine University with a degree in Accounting. I
        worked in Tax and Accounting Operations for most of my career. My most
        recent job was with the State of Minnesota working in the Accounting
        Division and handling the financial operations for the State. During
        this time, I gained experience with using Oracle database structures and
        Microsoft Access Database to maintain and build systems for the
        operations team. During my time, the State's Financial Accounting system
        had to undergo a large upgrade that would essentially change the user's
        interaction with the system. I assisted in writing test scripts and with
        testing the functional aspects of the new system. It was during this
        time, that I discovered a passion for working on technical issues and
        aiding in the solution and implemenation of the upgrade. Knowing that I
        had a real passion for the technology side, I enrolled into the
        University of Minnesota Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp. Once I
        finish the bootcamp, I hope to have a strong foundation for beginning a
        career in web development.
